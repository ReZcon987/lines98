Just a simple ball-smashing game written in Python.

No license, no copyrights. Just pull it and make your own game.

Unfortunately, nobody made a guide about how to play. Can you?

How to play:
The goal of the game is to leave the cells empty for as long as possible. 
Once you collect five balls of the same color in a row, they will disappear, but each move you make in random cells adds 3 balls.

Controls:
To move the ball, you first need to click on the ball you want to move and then click on a free cell
